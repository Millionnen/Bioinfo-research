# Bioinfo-research by Millionnen (bioinformatic attempt) 2022

Use of python and home-made scripts in the development of my thesis, most of them could use some advice and help, even tho i'm open to theory discussions about analysis and general feedback would be mery much appreciated. This research is in the field of Epitranscriptomic Gene regulation and this bioinformatic thesis is oriented to understand and generate knowledge in codon usage using Drosophila melanogaster as biologycal model.
